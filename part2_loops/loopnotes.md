## âœ… Use for loop when:
You know how many times the loop should run (fixed number of iterations).
You're using a counter variable (like i = 0 to 10).
Initialization, condition, and increment all belong together.

-ðŸ“Œ Use Case: Looping through arrays, ranges, or when count-based logic is needed.

## âœ… Use while loop when:
You donâ€™t know how many times the loop should run in advance.
The loop should run until a condition becomes false, and the control logic is outside the loop.
Useful when reading user input or waiting for a condition.

ðŸ“Œ Use Case: User-driven input, waiting for a sensor signal, game loop, or any condition-based repetition.

## do...while loop?
A do...while loop is a post-test loop:

It runs the loop body first, then checks the condition.

So the loop always executes at least once, even if the condition is false at the start.
